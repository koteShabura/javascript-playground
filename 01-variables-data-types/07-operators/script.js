//1.aritmetic operators

let x;
x = 5+5;
x = 5-5;
x = 5*5;
x = 5/5;
x = 7%5;

//concatenation
x = 'hello'+'_'+'world';

//exponent
x = 5**2;
//increment
x = 1;
//same as x = x+1 but shorter
x++;
//decrement
//works same as increment
x--;
//x = x-1

//assigment operator

x= 10;
x +=5;

// same as x = x+5
//worls with other operatores too

x = 20
x-=10

x = 20
x/=2


x= 20
x**=2



//3. comparison operators 

x = 2 == '2';
//return is true bc  double == dont care what type it is only chacks if it is same 

x = 2 === '2';
//return is false bc it chack types and bc 2 and '2' isnt same type one is number and second is string it returns false
//---------------------

x = 2 != 3;
//return is true bc 3 inst same as 2
x = 2 != 2;
//false bc 2 = 2
x = 2 !== '2';
//return is true bc '2' and 2 isnt same
//--------------------

x = 10 > 5
x = 10 < 5
x = 10 <= 5
x = 10 >= 5





console.log(x);
